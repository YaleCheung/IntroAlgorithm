=================================================================================

HASH
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### for link interface
1. The link interface should be fixed for hash link, especially the Search method.
2. Although debug is over, but I should add some exception to avoid Delete nothing in Link<T>::Delete
3. Link interface  has been fixed;
4. codes are not robust for the delete not always execute delete option
5. Global hash is not fixed;
6. The interface of hash fun is not right
